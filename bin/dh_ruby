=head1 NAME

dh_ruby - debhelper7 build system for Ruby software

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_ruby> [I<OPTIONS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_ruby> is a Debhelper 7 build system for Ruby software. It will
automatically build and install files contained in Ruby packages, trying to
work as close to Rubygems as possible but respecting Debian standards for Ruby
packages.

dh_ruby can automatically run your tests against all supported Ruby versions,
see the "FILES" section below.

See dh_ruby --help for details.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--clean>, B<--configure>, B<--build>, B<--test>, B<--install>

Commands called by debhelper at various steps of the build process.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Displays B<dh_ruby> usage information.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Displays B<dh_ruby> version information.

=item B<--setuprb>

This option indicates that the build should use I<setup.rb> rather
than the usual gem-based build. To take effect, this option must come
first !

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

=over

=item I<DH_RUBY_IGNORE_TESTS>

This is a space-separated list of tests that dh_ruby will ignore during package
build. The available test names are "require-rubygems" plus the names os all
supported Ruby versions. At the time of writing, only "ruby1.8" and "ruby1.9.1"
are supported.

If set to "all", all tests will be ignored during the package build.

=item I<DH_RUBY_USE_DH_AUTO_INSTALL_DESTDIR>

If this variable is defined (to anything), dh_ruby will respect the directory
informed by dh_auto_install(1), usually I<debian/tmp>. By default, gem2deb will
install files to debian/I<package>, where I<package> is the first binary
package listed in debian/control.

This is useful for multi-binary source packages, where you will have all files
installed to I<debian/tmp>, and can them split the files into separate packages
by using debian/I<package>.install.

=item I<DH_RUBY_GEMSPEC>

Determines which file contain the gem specification with package metadata.  By
default, dh_ruby will read metadata from a .gemspec file in the root of source
package directory. You can use this variable to override that if want to
provide custom metadata for the Debian package.

In the case there are more than one .gemspec in the source package root, you
will I<need> to use DH_RUBY_GEMSPEC to instruct dh_ruby about which one to use.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over

=item debian/I<ruby-test-files.yaml>, debian/I<ruby-tests.rake>, debian/I<ruby-tests.rb>

Theses files can be used to explicitly tell dh_ruby how to run the tests in your
package. When running the tests, dh_ruby will automatically set RUBYLIB to
include the appropriate directories where the package files were installed in
your package to make sure the tests use them instead of the files in the source
directory.

B<Your package can only contain at most one of these files.>

debian/I<ruby-test-files.yaml> must contain a YAML document with a list of test
files to be run. If the package metadata contains an explicit list of test
files, gem2deb(1) will automatically generate this file for you. Example from
ruby-mime-types:

  --- 
  - test/test_mime_type.rb
  - test/test_mime_types.rb

debian/I<ruby-tests.rake> can be used to run the tests with rake(1). If you use
this file, your package must Build-Depend on the I<rake> package. You can use
anything you would use in a regular Rakefile, but you must define a default
task. gem2deb includes utility test task that makes it easier for you by
creating a default task automatically. Example:

  require 'gem2deb/rake/testtask'
  Gem2Deb:Rake::TestTask.new do |t|
    t.test_files = FileList['test/*_test.rb']
  end

If debian/I<ruby-tests.rb> exists, it will be run with each supported Ruby
version, and must finish with a exit status of I<0>, otherwise dh_ruby assumes
the tests failed. A simple example:

  require 'test/unit'
  require 'mypackage' # if 'mypackage.rb' or 'mypackage.so' was not installed properly, this will fail
  class MyPackageTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_features
      assert_equal 4, MyPackage.sum(2,2)
    end
  end

=item debian/I<require-rubygems.overrides>

Fine-tune the "require-rubygems" test. If the package has a very good reason to
actually `require "rubygems"`, you can use this file as a whitelist of files
allowed to have `require "rubygems"`.

This file is expect to contain a YAML document with a list of files that must
be ignored when checking for `require "rubygems"` lines. Example:

  --- 
  - lib/foo.rb
  - lib/foo/rubygems.rg
